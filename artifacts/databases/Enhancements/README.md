# Category Three: Databases — Enhancements (CS-499) 

## Overview 
This folder documents all database-related enhancements made to the Travlr web application for my CS-499 ePortfolio. These updates focus on improving reliability, validation, and database performance through structured schema design, error handling, and connection management.

## Purpose of the Enhancements 
The goal was to strengthen the application’s interaction with MongoDB by adding **connection stability**, **graceful shutdown**, **schema validation**, and **consistent database error handling**. These changes improve data integrity, performance, and resilience — all key aspects of database design in production systems.

## Summary of Enhancements 

### **1. `travlr/app.js`** 
- Ensured the database connection loads before routes to prevent missing models.
- Added standardized JSON responses for all API-level database errors.
- Introduced structured request logging and improved error tracking.

### **2. `travlr/app_api/models/db.js`** 
- Added retry and back-off logic for initial connections.
- Introduced graceful shutdown hooks for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`.
- Commented all connection event handlers to explain behavior and purpose.

### **3. `travlr/app_api/models/travlr.js`** 
- Added detailed field validation, regex enforcement, and numeric ranges.
- Created an index on `start` for efficient sorting and pagination.
- Documented each schema field for clarity and long-term maintainability.

### **4. `travlr/app_api/controllers/trips.js`** 
- Integrated Joi validation to prevent invalid or missing fields.
- Implemented pagination and consistent 404/409 database responses.
- Enabled `runValidators` in `findOneAndUpdate` to enforce schema rules during updates.

### **5. `travlr/app_api/controllers/authentication.js`** 
- Improved user registration by catching database errors and returning user-friendly messages.
- Replaced raw MongoDB error responses with clear JSON messages.
- Added a simple login attempt throttle to prevent repeated failed queries.

### **6. `travlr/app_api/config/passport.js`** 
- Renamed unclear variables for readability.
- Added rate-limit logic to slow repeated failed authentication attempts.
- Improved database query handling for cleaner, more stable user lookups.

## Skills Demonstrated 
- Applying best practices in **database schema design** and **validation**.
- Implementing **connection retry and graceful shutdown** patterns for persistence reliability.
- Designing **data integrity checks** and structured error handling.
- Improving query performance with **indexes** and efficient data access strategies.

## Result 
After enhancement, the database layer became reliable, resilient, and optimized for performance. These updates demonstrate professional-level skills in database design, validation, and fault-tolerant application development.
