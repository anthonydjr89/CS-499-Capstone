# Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure 

This folder contains the original and enhanced versions of the algorithmic components used in the Travlr application. The work here focuses on improving performance and scalability through efficient data handling and structural logic. 

- **Original** – Contains the initial versions of all related files before enhancements.
- **Enhancements** – Contains the improved versions that implement pagination, indexing, and optimized data handling.

Each enhancement demonstrates applied algorithm and data structure concepts designed to improve system efficiency and maintainability.
