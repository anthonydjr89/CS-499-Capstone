# Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure â€” Enhancements (CS-499) 

## Overview 
This folder documents the algorithmic and data structure improvements made to the Travlr application for my CS-499 ePortfolio. The updates focus on improving efficiency, scalability, and structured data handling in both the backend and frontend. 

## Purpose of the Enhancements 
The enhancements were implemented to make the trip management process more efficient as data volume increases. They apply practical algorithmic improvements, including **pagination**, **indexed lookups**, and **optimized data structures** for API responses. This work demonstrates my ability to identify and solve performance problems through algorithmic design choices.

Core logic for each enhancement was first outlined using pseudocode to evaluate structure and trade-offs before implementation.

## Summary of Enhancements 

[**travlr/app_api/controllers/trips.js**](./trips.js)
- Added **pagination** with `page` and `limit` parameters.
- Implemented a consistent API structure `{ data, page, limit, total }`.
- Added input validation using Joi to improve data integrity.
- Improved efficiency by limiting results and sorting via indexed fields.

[**travlr/app_api/models/travlr.js**](./travlr.js)
- Added a **regex rule** for trip code format and numeric range limits for prices.
- Introduced an **index on the `start` field** for faster queries and sorting.
- Documented schema fields for clarity and long-term maintainability.

[**travlr/app_admin/src/app/services/trip-data.service.ts**](./trip-data.service.ts)
- Added **paged request support** to match backend pagination.
- Introduced typed response handling to process structured JSON efficiently.
- Clarified that name is used for registration but not for login.

[**travlr/app_admin/src/app/trip-listing/trip-listing.component.ts**](./trip-listing.component.ts)
- Updated component logic to **load trips page-by-page** instead of all at once.
- Added local variables for page, limit, and total count.
- Prepared the UI to support efficient filtering and future search features.

## Skills Demonstrated 
- Application of algorithmic design principles to improve runtime performance.
- Implementation of pagination and index-based data access to manage large datasets.
- Integration of data structures that define predictable, reusable API responses.
- Understanding of **time complexity (O(k) vs. O(n))** and real-world performance trade-offs.

## Result 
After these enhancements, the Travlr application efficiently manages trip data, handles larger record sets, and maintains stable performance. This demonstrates practical use of algorithms and data structure concepts to improve both backend and frontend efficiency in a production-style environment.
