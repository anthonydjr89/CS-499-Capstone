# Code Review â€“ CS 499 Capstone 

## This video presents my informal code review of the artifacts selected for my CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio. In the review, I walk through the existing code functionality, analyze areas for improvement, and outline enhancement plans across all three core categories of computer science: 

- **Software Design and Engineering** 
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** 
- **Databases** 

The code review demonstrates my ability to identify design, efficiency, and security issues while proposing realistic solutions that align with industry standards and the five CS-499 course outcomes.

## Key Discussion Points 

### Software Design & Engineering 
- Reviewed the structure and maintainability of the main project. 
- Identified opportunities for better modularity and consistent error handling. 
- Planned enhancements included improved route protection, UI consistency, and exception logging. 

### Algorithms & Data Structures 
- Evaluated algorithmic logic for efficiency and scalability. 
- Proposed optimization of PBKDF2 password hashing iterations and input validation logic. 
- Added Angular debounce for better client-side performance. 

### Databases 
- Analyzed schema constraints, indexing, and data reliability. 
- Planned enhancements included schema validation, retry logic, and indexed queries to improve performance and resilience.

## Alignment With Course Outcomes 
This code review supports all five CS-499 course outcomes by demonstrating: 
1. Collaborative and analytical communication skills. 
2. The ability to design, develop, and present coherent technical material. 
3. The evaluation of computing solutions through algorithmic principles. 
4. The application of modern engineering techniques and best practices. 
5. A proactive security mindset focused on reducing vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps 
The enhancements outlined in this review were implemented and demonstrated through my three artifact submissions: 
- [Software Design & Engineering Enhancement](../artifacts/software-design/README.md) 
- [Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement](../artifacts/algorithms/README.md) 
- [Databases Enhancement](../artifacts/databases/README.md)
